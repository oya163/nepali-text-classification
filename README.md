# Nepali Text Classification

This is my independent research project to do something with deep learning in Nepali language.

It might be frustrating that everything is in ipython notebook. You might wanna contact me if you get stuck somewhere in the code or for the data. I learned a lot during this project.

Thanks for the previous contributors:

* [Nepali National Corpus](https://www.sketchengine.eu/nepali-national-corpus/)

I slightly modified **Natural Language Toolkit: Plaintext Corpus Reader** to incorporate Nepali National Corpus (NNC) into Gensim models for Word2Vec and Fasttext word embeddings. Please see NNCCorpus.py
